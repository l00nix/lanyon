I finally got my hands on the most highly spec'ed out Raspberry Pi Compute Model 4.  As of writing of this post, the Raspberry Pi CM4108032 Compute Module comes with 32 GB eMMC on board storrage, 8 GB RAM and  WiFi 2.4/5.0 GHz 802.11b/g/n/ac.

Since, like all the other 8 GB RAM models of the CM4, can only mostly be ordered in bulk. I found and ordered the CM4 from [Welectron](https://www.welectron.com/Raspberry-Pi-CM4108032-Compute-Module-32-GB-8-GB-RAM-WLAN_1){:target="_blank"}  in Germany. 

The original reason for getting this version of the module was to use the 8GB model for NavCoin staking as recommended in the [NavCoin Staking on a RPi CM4 post]({% post_url 2021-06-13-navcoin-staking %}). This still will be the final use case for this compute module but in the meantime I want to play around with it and install [VMWare ESXi for arm](https://flings.vmware.com/esxi-arm-edition){:target="_blank"}  on it.

Stay tuned!
