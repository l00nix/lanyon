I subscribe to [Jeff Gerling's YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCR-DXc1voovS8nhAvccRZhg){:target="_blank"} as I always like to watch his videos about the latest projects, he is putting the Raspberry Pi Compute Module 4 (CM4) through. 

To my surprise he featured my Less is More (LiM) Carrier Board in his latest video released on Jul 12, 2021 â€“ (Starting at 2min 45secs to 2mins 57secs).

Thanks @Jeff Geerling for the mention. 

I am expecting the prototypes for the LiM Carrier Board this week so stay tuned for further updates on this. There is also a LiM+ Carrier Board in the prototyping stage, which will hopefully add flashing capabilities to the LiM Carrier Board.
