title: NavCoin Staking on a RPi CM4

As I mentioned in my ealier [RPi Musings post]({% post_url 2021-06-13-my-musings %}) one of the drivers to switch to a new RPi platform was that I had to find an upgrade from my RPi 3+ that I used for NavCoin staking. 

I had used [NavPi](https://navhub.org/projects/nav-pi/){:target="_blank"} on my RPi 3+ but with Navcon 6.x I felt the time was right to move to a Compute Module 4 for a headless low power staking option.

It took me quite some time to get it working as instructions were difficult to find. The NavPi could be managed through a GUI and the Navcoin 6.x implementation came with a nice Qt GUI frontend. 

However I was interested in staking headless. So I wrote a how to stake Navcoin [here](https://deploy-preview-29--navcoin-knowledge-base.netlify.app//navcoin-core/headless-staking-including-raspberry-pi-4-and-cm4/){:target="_blank"}.

The guide was kept generic as it applies to all platforms but it was written based on my RPi CM4 implementation.
