In anticipation of the [LiM Carrier Board](https://lim.loonix.ca/){:target="_blank"} prototype for the RPi CM4 arriving, I ordered some heatsinks. I showed the idea of the LiM Carrier Board to [Jeff Geerling](https://www.jeffgeerling.com/){:target="_blank"} and his comment was : "Slap a heat sink on top of the CM4 and put it in a little box and you have a truly wireless computer you can throw into any scenario..."
To be honest, this was exactly what I am trying to aim for with the LiM Board, create a [Raspberry Pi Zero W](https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/raspberry-pi-zero-w/){:target="_blank"} on steroids.

I decided to order a couple of the [12mm Aluminum Alloy Heatsink (C235) for Raspberry Pi Compute Module 4](https://geekworm.com/products/cm4-12mm-aluminum-alloy-heatsink-c235?_pos=11&_sid=eee1b8e13&_ss=r){:target="_blank"} from Geekworm.

Update - June 29, 2021: The heatsinks arrived. I received them a ouple of days ago but have not have a chance to post yet.

Here are some pictures of the heatsinks with the CM4 and a matchbox for size comparison. I haven't installed the heatsink(s) yet as I am waiting for the LiM(+) board prototypes to arrive but I am posting a 3D render of what the assembly will look like.
