title: Staking Navcoin - CPU temperature

The 'unlock wallet' time expired recently on my Raspberry Pi CM4 (CM4104032). It happened over night so it took me a bit to unlock the wallet again. In the meantime the temperature observation on the CM4  looks like a 6Â°C difference between idle and staking.
